Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
1. `MAJOR` version when your document has undergone significant changes,
2. `MINOR` version when new information has been added to the document or information has been removed from the document, and
3. `PATCH` version when you made minor changes (e.g. fixing typos).
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
